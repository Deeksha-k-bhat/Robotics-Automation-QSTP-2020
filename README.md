# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2020
Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations
coming out with a rapid pace. The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of Python including branching,
looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool in the course is the
Robotics Operating System (ROS) - a software framework designed to make robotics
development easier. Alongside will be working with Gazebo which is a
robotics simulator where you can create your own robot models or even test out code
on pre existing Turtlebot.
